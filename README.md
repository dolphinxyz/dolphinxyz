### ~~~ Hi there, welcome on my Github

Along the years I developed many ideas while trying to learn new skills.
Everything, always, inside my laptop.
After having invested many energies improving my life's framework, I realized it was time to go live, taking care of my digital identity.
Uploaded all the code, published my website, start streaming, resume is fully public.

I had the opportunity to grow up in a strong engineering|chaotic ecosystem, developing since the first years a deep confidence with computers.
Thinking analytically is for me a natural predisposition, as well as my research in creativity and aesthetic. I shine working between the lines, connecting magic with logic. With experience I understood the importance for me to work with companies I trust their mission.
