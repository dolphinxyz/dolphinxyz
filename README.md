### ~~~ Hi there, welcome on my Github

Along the years I developed many ideas while trying to learn new skills.<br/>
Everything, always, inside my laptop.<br/>
After having invested many energies improving my life's framework, I realized it was time to go live, taking care of my digital identity.<br/>
Uploaded all the code, published my website, start streaming, resume is fully public.<br/>

I had the opportunity to grow up in a strong engineering yet chaotic ecosystem.<br/>
As consequence, thinking analytically is for me a natural predisposition, as well as researching creativity and aesthetic.<br/>
I shine between the lines, connecting magic with logic.<br/>
Over time, I realized how important it is for me to work for companies I believe in.
